# FR-HNS-
## Overview
This project focuses on detecting and analyzing facial regions (FR) and head‑neck structures (HNS) using machine learning techniques. 
It provides a structured workflow from data collection to model evaluation.

## Objectives
Accurately detect faces and associated head‑neck regions in images
Explore various feature extraction and classification methods
Evaluate model performance with quantitative metrics
Present visual and analytical insights based on results

## Data
The repository includes documented datasets comprising annotated images, along with details like data source, sample counts, and annotation formats.

## Approach
### The project’s workflow consists of:
Data ingestion and exploratory analysis
Preprocessing and annotation refinement
Feature engineering and selection
Model development and training
Evaluation using appropriate metrics (e.g. accuracy, F1‑score)
Visualization to support findings and guide improvements

## Requirements
This project uses standard Python libraries for data handling, machine learning, and visualization. Dependencies are documented in the repository.

## Structure
Organized folders for raw data, processed datasets, and trained models
Notebooks with step‑by‑step documentation of preprocessing, model building, and evaluation
Supporting documentation explaining design choices and experimental setup

## Results & Insights
Summary of model performance across different configurations
Key observations about influential features and error patterns
Visual aids highlighting detection accuracy and failure cases

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. You can help with:
Adding new preprocessing pipelines or models
Extending analysis with additional visualizations
Enhancing documentation or improving experiment reproducibility
